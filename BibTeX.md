abstract = {The Cloud infrastructure services landscape advances steadily leaving users in the agony of choice. As a result, Cloud service identication and discovery remains a hard problem due to dierent service descriptions, non- standardised naming conventions and heterogeneous types and features of Cloud services. In this paper, analysis the research challenges and present a Web Ontology Language (OWL) based ontology, the Cloud Computing Ontology (CoCoOn). It denes functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We also present a system, CloudRecommender, that implements our domain ontology in a relational model. The system uses regular expressions and Structured Query Language (SQL) for matching user requests to service descriptions. We brie y describe the architecture of the CloudRecommender system, and demonstrate its eectiveness and scalability through a service conguration selection experiment based on a set of prominent Cloud providers' descriptions including Amazon, Azure, and GoGrid.},
